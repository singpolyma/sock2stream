This is an initial implementation of a socket multiplexer/demultiplexer to tunnel Unix domain sockets over pipes/streams.

The primary envisioned use is to tunnel Unix domain sockets over SSH like so:

> mkfifo /tmp/sockin
> ssh user@host socket2stream -l /path/to/remotesocket < /tmp/sockin | socket2stream -r /path/to/localsocket > /tmp/sockin
